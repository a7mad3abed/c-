# c-
This is a snake game made with ncurses and c++. Although the use of c++ is limited to the use of vector as the better alternativ 
to linked lists. Here too I have used chrono instead of ctime. With ctime i had a segmentation fault after eating about 20 foods.
After debugging with gdb I was able to find that problem.

The program is to be compiled und run under linux environment or equivalents. 
I hope anybody can benefit from this piece of code.
